The script notify.sh can be used to notify you about limit hits. For that purpose you have to schedule the script to be run regularly using methods like cron.
**FORMAT**

The format of the email generated by the notify.sh is as below : 

STACK VIOLATIONS
	<Details>
SOFT CPU TIME VIOLATION
	<Details>
FILE SIZE VIOLATION
	<Details>
PROCESS NUMBER VIOLATION
	<Details>
NUMBER OF FILES VIOLATION
	<Details>
MEMLOCK VIOLATION
	<Details>
AS VIOLATION
	<Details>
RLIMIT VIOLATION
	<Details>

The format of each line of <Details> can be given as follows :

<Number of this particular violations> uid=<UID> exe=<EXE FILE>	pid=<PROCESS ID> Time Stamp=<Time Stamp> parent_comm=<PARENT COMMAND> parent_exe=<PARENT EXE>

At times you may need to get all the predecessors, rather than the immediate
parent. In such a case , you may use the script scripts/predecessor.sh. To get
all the predecessors of the failed process, you may execute the following :

predecessors.sh <PID> <TS>

PID is the process id of the failed process and the TS is the time stamp of
the failed process , both as specified in the violation mail.
